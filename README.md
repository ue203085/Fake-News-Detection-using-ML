# Fake-News-Detection-using-ML
The task of fake news detection is defined here as the prediction of the chances of a particular news article (news report, editorial, expose, etc.) being intentionally deceptive (fake, fabricated, staged news, or a hoax).
Train a Bidirectional Neural Network and LSTM based deep learning model to detect fake news from a given news corpus.
– Learned the theory and intuition behind Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTM
– Created a pipeline to remove stop words, perform tokenization and padding on text corpus to feed the model
– Implemented using Tensorflow and obtained the accuracy of 99.68% on the model

This project could be practically used by any media company to automatically predict whether the circulating news is fake or not. The process could be done automatically without having humans manually review thousands of news related articles.
